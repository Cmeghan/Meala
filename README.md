# Meala

The Meala website was set up as a landing page for a local hair-styling business named 'Meala', looking to entice potential new customers, and aid existing customers in making bookings, and gathering information.

## Features 

The website has been set up with all the information a customer should need prior to making a booking or consultation, this includes pricing, contact information, information about the services rendered, along with information regarding the stylist themselves.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Gallery and FAQ page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

- __The landing page image__

  - The landing includes a photograph with text overlay to allow the user to see the location of the salon.
  - This section introduces the user to Meala with an 'on-brand' image of the client's salon.

- __Image Bar__

  - After speaking to the client, they advised that besides the gallery, they also wanted the user to see their work on the homepage, so that potential clients can see the clients work immediately after opening the website.

- __Price List__

  - I've included a price list for all services rendered by the client.
  - I have included this on the front page as typically this information is of paramount importance to customers, and being upfront about pricing creates a good user experience.

- __Reviews__ 

  - The reviews section covers some feedback provided by previous customers.
  - This gives potential new customers an idea of the services provided by Meala and may offer comfort when booking an appointment.

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Meala. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 
  - The footer also contains the opening hours and location of the salon
  - The footer also contains a form in which the user can contact the salon directly through the site.
  - The footer contains all this information across every page to ensure ease of contact for any potential customers.

- __Gallery__

  - The gallery will provide the user with supporting images to see the quality of the clients work. 
  - This section is valuable to the user as they will be able to see finished styles and creations available at Meala and decide for themselves from the images if they'd like to make an appointment.

- __FAQ Page__

  - This page will allow the user to view multiple queries relating to hair extensions. Which is the most complicated and expensive service offered by Meala.
  - This page is valuable as this product requires a consultation, and having as much information possible before a client decides to make an appointment creates a good user experience.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another idea for future implementation would be to include an online booking system, in which a person can make the appointment directly through the site, without having to contact the salon prior. 

## Testing 

- I tested the section through the inspect tool on Google for various screen sizes.
- I also opened the website on my phone, ipad and a laptop, all of which were responsive.
- I noticed while testing on my ipad that IOS automatically colors buttons as blue, so I had to go back and declare a background color of white so that it appeared the same across different OS.
