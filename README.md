MEALA 
======
The Meala website was set up as a landing page for a local hair-styling business named 'Meala', looking to entice potential new customers, and aid existing customers in making bookings, and gathering information. 

The website has been set up with all the information a customer should need prior to making a booking or consultation, this includes pricing, contact information, information about the services rendered, along with information regarding the stylist themselves.

FEATURES 
-----
- Navigation 
The Navigation bar is featured at the top left of the page. With the brand/website name in the top left corner, which when clicked takes the user back to the homepage. 
The 3 pages within the website are located on the top right of the page on each page to easily navigate throughout the website. 
The client's brand is simple and uses a lot of natural tones so I chose a simple font with brown/tan colors which contrast eachother for ease of visibility, while complimenting the client's brand.

- Header 
The header shows images of the client's workspace, which suits the overall theme of the website in color. 
The header immediately showcases the location of the business and the name of the brand, overlapping the background image. 
The fonts are consistent and subtle throughout.

- Footer 
The Footer across all 3 pages contains multiple ways to contact the business.
It contains the address of the business and the phone number.
It contains a contact form for users to contact the business directly through the website. 
It contains the opening hours of the business.
It contains links to the business' multiple social media platforms. 
All this information was placed in the footer across the website so that users always have easy access to contacting the business without needing to look for this information themselves.

- BUGS

Struggled to push through data to Github as I made a change on Github while Gitpod coding was still open. Kept receiving error “tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart”

When I tried to fix error by using "git pull" I kept receiving error "fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting." 

I googled the error and found a suggestion here "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13106179/fatal-not-possible-to-fast-forward-aborting" 

Terminal bug error resolution:
