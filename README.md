MEALA 
======
The Meala website was set up as a landing page for a local hair-styling business named 'Meala', looking to entice potential new customers, and aid existing customers in making bookings, and gathering information. 

The website has been set up with all the information a customer should need prior to making a booking or consultation, this includes pricing, contact information, information about the services rendered, along with information regarding the stylist themselves.

FEATURES 
-----
- Navigation 
The Navigation bar is featured at the top left of the page. With the brand/website name in the top left corner, which when clicked takes the user back to the homepage. 
The 3 pages within the website are located on the top right of the page on each page to easily navigate throughout the website. 
The client's brand is simple and uses a lot of natural tones so I chose a simple font with brown/tan colors which contrast eachother for ease of visibility, while complimenting the client's brand.
